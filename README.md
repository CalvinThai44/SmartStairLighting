# SmartStairLighting

Project to create animated stair lighting using an arduino to host logic and perform controls.

Plans:

1. Lighting for 10+ stairs.
2. Manual/remote override of features.
3. Sensor based triggers determining direction of animation.
4. Step up and step down animations.
5. Light sensor measurement for disabling/enabling animation.
6. Debugging tools/support.
